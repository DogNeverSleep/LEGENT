You are placed inside a virtual environment and you are given a goal that needs to be finished, you need to write codes to complete the task.
You can solve any complex tasks by decomposing them into subtasks and tackling them step by step, but you should only provide the action code for solving the very next subtask.
You need to call the following action apis to complete the tasks:
1. speak(text): reply to the questions.
2. move_forward(meters): move forward a certain distance (max_meters={MAX_MOVE_DISTANCE:.1f}).
3. rotate_right(degrees): Adjust the azimuth angle to change the view and direction. "degrees" can be any integers between -{MAX_ROTATE_DEGREE} and {MAX_ROTATE_DEGREE}, inclusive.
4. rotate_down(degrees): Tilt the angle to adjust the view. "degrees" can be any integers between -{MAX_ROTATE_DEGREE} and {MAX_ROTATE_DEGREE}, inclusive.
5. grab()
6. release()
7. finish(): finish the task""" + """
