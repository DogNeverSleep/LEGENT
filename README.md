# Introduction

LEGENT is a platform for embodied agent.

One day, robots will perceive the environment as we do, communicate with us through natural language and help us with our tasks. The platform is dedicated to developing future robots that can chat, see, and act from virtual world to real world, powered by large models.
We aspire to democratize the research in this field for anyone interested. LEGENT is a pioneering open-source solution combining large models with embodied agents, prioritizing ease of use and scalability. The platform focuses on developing the following functionalities:

1. An easy-to-use environment that simulates a physical world, where an agent can interact with humans through language, receive egocentric vision, and perform physical actions.

2. Automated generation of training data, including the generation of scenes, tasks, and ground truth actions. **We aspire to exploit supervision from simulated worlds at scale**. The design of the platform is tailored to facilitate the development of generalizable embodied agents based on large models.

3. Implementation of important models for embodied agents, such as vision-language-action models.
